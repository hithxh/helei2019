The dataset contains the source code for the article: time/sequence-dependent scheduling: the design and evaluation of a general purpose tabu-based adaptive large neighbourhood search algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested on a class of scheduling problems with time/sequence-dependent setup times and time windows, including a real-world multi-orbit agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem (AEOSS), an order acceptance and scheduling problem (OAS) and a time-dependent orienteering problem with time windows (TDOPTW). The datasets of the three domains are available at: https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:1a4e5895-7dae-4b6a-9315-a9e8cb463d73.

A demo project which runs the algorithm 10 times on each of the instances of the three domains and outputs the results is in 'Demo project'. If you would like to run the demo, please download the above three datasets and put them in folder 'Demo project'.
